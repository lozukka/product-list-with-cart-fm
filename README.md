## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned so much during this challenge. I have been learning Javascript for a while now, and I have done one shopping cart, but it was a very basic and simple one. This felt like a real-word-thing.
Things that I learned:

- a popup screen
- edit DOM in several places at the same time
- how to create id-values
- how to build a little bigger project
- how to render the products from a JSON-file
